# e-commerce-back-end

## Task

Internet retail, also known as **e-commerce**, is the largest sector of the electronics industry, generating an estimated $29 trillion in 2019. E-commerce platforms like Shopify and WooCommerce provide a suite of services to businesses of all sizes. This task is to build a better understanding of the fundamental architecture of these platforms. It contains the back end for an e-commerce site, modifying starter code. An Express.js API uses Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.
